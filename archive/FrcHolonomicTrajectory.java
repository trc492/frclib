/**
 * This class modifies the behavior of the Trajectory class in a minor way.
 * The {@link FrcSwervePathFollower} class uses a {@link Trajectory} object to follow a path.
 * However, that class doesn't decouple heading from the velocity vector direction, which holonomic drivebases are capable of.
 * The path generation in {@link FrcPath#createHolonomicTrajectory} gets around this by modifying the heading values to
 * be the velocity vector directions instead of the target heading.
 * Since the path follower only uses the ending heading as the target (it doesn't use intermediate heading values) this wrapper class is the solution.
 * It acts identically to the Trajectory class most of the time, but when the final waypoint is being requested, the heading value is set as the target heading, not velocity direction.
 * This is basically bound to the implementation of {@link SwerveControllerCommand}, which isn't very elegant, but it works.
